    <h1>Iain Bustillos</h1>
    <p>I'm a 3rd year Data Science major at UCSD. I am a proud San Diegan, born and raised, which means that I'm absolutely in love with Cali Burritos and also anything to do with the beach :). Another thing about me is that I love playing the guitar and actaully play in a band!</p>

    <p>Outside of studying, my favourite thing to do is play soccer!</p>
